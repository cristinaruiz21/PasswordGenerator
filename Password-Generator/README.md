# Password-Generator
Objective: Generate a random password following the selected prompts. The user will select which criteria he/she would like in his/her password. This should help create a more secure password.

Things I learned: I learned how to create functions using variables and if/else statements. Specifically, I learned how to call certain variables based on what the user selects by using an "if" statement using a confirm variable. I also learned how to create a for loop using math.random and math.floor.

Obstacles I faced: I struggled to create the for loop to generate the random characters. I also had trouble with the alignment of the varibles and if statements inside of the function.
